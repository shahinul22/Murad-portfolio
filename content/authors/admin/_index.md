## About Me

I'm a third year computer science student at Department of Computer Science & Engineering . As my hobby, i love to learn new things and build up myself as a better professional. I'm also learning Java, data structure, C & machine learning. My aim is to learn more new skills and make them my own in the future. During these days i am not so much interested but i try to gain some experience of life and people around me which can help me with some new things too.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movie, photography, and spending time with my cats. I am also constantly learning new technologies to stay updated with the latest trends in software development.
